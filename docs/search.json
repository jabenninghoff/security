    "text": "Example Data\nGenerate realistic example data to populate the Excel spreadsheet. As discovered in practice, while the initial risks (“cybersecurity breach” and “technology outage”) are raised by the technology team, we find that the business risks (here represented by “loss of customer”) are significantly larger, caused by the functional obsolescence of the inventory system.\n\nFrequency\nExperts are asked to estimate the frequency of an adverse event, which is used as the average arrival rate for a Poisson distribution (\\(\\lambda\\)).\nFrom my breach rate analysis, the largest firms experience a cybersecurity breach about once every three years (\\(\\lambda\\) = 0.347). A reasonably high breach rate for a system is between 0.2 and 0.33.\nFrom my own experience, an unstable system might experience between 1-4 technology outages per year; a \\(\\lambda\\) of 2 fits this nicely:\n\nggplot(data.frame(x = rpois(1e5, 2)), aes(x)) +\n  geom_hist_bw(binwidth = 1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_width(1, offset = 1)) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme_quo(minor = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the third risk, loss of customer, the firm has already experienced a loss, and expects this to increase. For loss of customer we also choose a \\(\\lambda\\) of 2.\n\n\nImpact\nDrawing from the IRIS 2022 report, the loss magnitude of a cybersecurity breach follows a log-normal distribution with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 12.56 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 3.07, which gives a log-transformed lognormal curve of:\n\nggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 25)), aes(x)) +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 12.56, sd = 3.07)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme_quo()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: from Making sense of the rlnorm() function in R:\n\nrlnorm(n = 1000000, meanlog = 7, sdlog = 75) and exp(rnorm(n = 1000000, mean = 7, sd = 75)) produce the same result\n\nAn expert estimate matching this outcome for a breach would have low (5%), high (95%) and most likely values of:\n\nqlnorm(c(0.05, 0.95, 0.5), meanlog = 12.56, sdlog = 3.07)\n\n[1]     1826.76 44442227.03   284930.34\n\n\nFor a technology outage, a mean of 0.1 and a standard deviation of 1.7 are reasonable choices for parameters that fit the data for outage duration from the 2022 VOID Report:\n\nggplot(data.frame(x = rlnorm(1e3, meanlog = 0.1, sdlog = 1.7)), aes(x)) +\n  geom_hist_bw(binwidth = 1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 80)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme_quo(minor = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives low (5%), high (95%) and most likely values of:\n\nqlnorm(c(0.05, 0.95, 0.5), meanlog = 0.1, sdlog = 1.7)\n\n[1]  0.06745793 18.10614106  1.10517092\n\n\nThis fits with my own experience; most outages last around an hour, and 95% of outages are resolved in 18 hours or less. From this, we can calculate a reasonable outage cost by multiplying by a per-hour rate. We assume that the main cost is caused by response and overtime paid out to catch up after the system is restored, $10K/hour.\n\nqlnorm(c(0.05, 0.95, 0.5), meanlog = 0.1, sdlog = 1.7) * 10000\n\n[1]    674.5793 181061.4106  11051.7092\n\n\nFor loss of customer, we estimate the low (5%) and high (95%) values at $100K and $20M respectively; these are reasonable choices given the size of the firm. We can test this by calculating the most likely value, after determining the mean and standard deviation using the approach from this StackExchange Post:\nThe mean is calculated using: \\(\\mu = \\large \\frac{\\log(high) - \\log(low)}{2}\\)\n\nmeanlog_customer &lt;- ((log(20000000) - log(100000)) / 2) + log(100000)\nmeanlog_customer\n\n[1] 14.16208\n\n\nThe standard deviation is calculated using: \\(\\DeclareMathOperator{\\qnorm}{qnorm} \\large \\sigma = \\frac{\\log(high) - \\log(low)}{2 \\times \\qnorm(0.95)}\\)\n\nsdlog_customer &lt;- (log(20000000) - log(100000)) / (2 * qnorm(0.95))\nsdlog_customer\n\n[1] 1.610574\n\n\nFrom this we get a customer impact range of:\n\nqlnorm(c(0.05, 0.95, 0.5), meanlog = meanlog_customer, sdlog = sdlog_customer)\n\n[1]   100000 20000000  1414214",

    "text": "Background\nIncident Metrics in SRE: Critically Evaluating MTTR and Friends demonstrated the difficulty at detecting changes in MTTR over time. The paper tests a 10% reduction in MTTR using Monte Carlo simulation, and found:\n\n“Yikes! Even though in the simulation the improvement always worked, 38% of the simulations had the MTTR difference fall below zero for Company A, 40% for Company B, and 20% for Company C. Looking at the absolute change in MTTR, the probability of seeing at least a 15-minute improvement is only 49%, 50%, and 64%, respectively. Even though the product in the scenario worked and shortened incidents, the odds of detecting any improvement at all are well outside the tolerance of 10% random flukes.”\n\nSafety Differently argues that we shouldn’t measure success based on the absence of negative events. We can use real data on data breaches and Monte Carlo simulation to explore the question, “Is an organization’s breach rate a useful metric?”",

    "text": "Conclusion\nEven in a “best case” scenario of a very large firm that is able to measure the number of breaches over a 10 year period, a 25% reduction in breach rate only results in a lower number of actual breaches less than 50% of the time. A sample period of 500 years or more is needed to have confidence that the breach rate has been reduced.\nRealistically, this means that the only way to test the effectiveness of security controls is by sampling across large numbers of firms. A single organization simply won’t have enough data to make reasonable conclusions based on events that happen so infrequently.",
