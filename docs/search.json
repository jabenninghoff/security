Using Monte Carlo simulation, we can calculate the value of this risk reduction.\nFor the analysis, we use a 10 year horizon to fit with the typical executive tenure of 5-10 years.

    "text": "Analysis\nWhat can we learn from these simulations? While a security investment is more likely than not to have a positive return, it’s not a particularly good bet. Over a reasonable planning horizon for a typical executive, it’s hard for an investment with a variable return to compete with investments that have a clear expected positive return. As a CISO, it’s a reasonable choice to simply maintain the status quo of the baseline risk, as there’s a good chance that there will be no breaches (25%) or breaches with lower impact:\n\nbaseline_forecast |&gt;\n  pull(npv) |&gt;\n  quantile(0.5) |&gt;\n  currency()\n\n        50% \n$250,867.66 \n\n\nPut another way, the analysis helps explain why firms don’t invest more in security: the firms’ managers are better off prioritizing non-security investments, and (potentially) blaming the CISO when breaches do occur, especially if they have limited their risk by purchasing cybersecurity insurance. A rational manager will minimize investments in security unless mandated by insurance or if increasing security spend is more than offset by reductions in premiums.\nFor the most part, this is what we often see in practice: security leaders struggling to get funding to improve security beyond what is minimally expected by external stakeholders (clients, regulators, and insurers). However, we also see certain larger organizations invest more in security, like large banks and other financial institutions, why is this? Work done by VivoSecurity in forecasting data breaches suggests an answer. Vivo found a positive correlation between the size of an organization and the likelihood of a security breach (which has also been identified by others, like Cyentia), and also found a negative correlation with the number of CISAs and CISSPs on staff. The correlation was stronger when looking at the effect on larger breaches.\nI believe what this correlation shows is that the overall level of security investment at a firm, as measured by the headcount of certified professionals, has a big impact on reducing the likelihood of the largest breaches of $1M or higher. From the same presentation, the Vivo model predicts fairly frequent small breaches (under $100K) at three of the largest Canadian banks, but large breaches are very rare (under 1% for breaches in the $1M-$10M range). The high level of investment at older banks may also be partly explained by the fact that their security programs predate commercial cyber insurance. This insight is not captured in the simple model presented here.",

    "text": "Implications\nWhat are the implications for security? At a macro level, I think this is an argument for regulation, either government regulation or private regulation through the insurance market. Historically we’ve seen both happen in fire safety: government regulation through building codes has reduced the risk of fire and loss of life over time, and insurance-driven regulations - UL, founded as Underwriters Laboratories, was initially funded by fire insurance companies.\nAt the firm level, I think this means that security leaders shouldn’t present security as an investment. As with safety, I think the main argument for better security is a moral or emotional case: we care about security because we care about our customers, partners, and other stakeholders. Also, people are typically loss-averse, so expressing security risk in those terms will better connect with decision makers. Using Tail value at risk or Loss Exceedance Curves express loss in this way - “There’s a 5% chance of cybersecurity losses exceeding $780,000 and a 1% chance of losses exceeding $25,000,000 over the next year.” I also think it means security leaders should be mindful of how they spend their limited funds, by maximizing investments in what works.",

    "text": "A Counterexample\nAfter completing my initial analysis, I remembered a counterexample: in one of his last presentations, Marcus Ranum described the layered security controls he helped put in place at an entertainment company that “didn’t want to be next” after the 2014 Sony attack. Marcus worked with their security team to implement a combination of encrypted drives, next-gen firewalls, and whitelisting products to dramatically reduce malware attacks against corporate endpoints. One of the surprising outcomes was that the investment in installing the new controls was more than offset by a reduction in operational costs responding to malware.\nSo it’s clear that security can be a good investment, but why? The conclusions in the initial analysis rely on the fact that security breaches are relatively infrequent, which was not the case for malware response at the company Marcus worked with. Additionally, these low-level infections aren’t likely to make their way into the public dataset used by the Cyentia IRIS report.",

As discovered in practice, while the initial risks (“cybersecurity breach” and “technology outage”) are raised by the technology team, we find that the business risks (here represented by “loss of customer”) are significantly larger, caused by the functional obsolescence of the inventory system.\n\nFrequency\nExperts are asked to estimate the frequency of an adverse event, which is used as the average arrival rate for a Poisson distribution (\\(\\lambda\\)).\nFrom my breach rate analysis, the largest firms experience a cybersecurity breach about once every three years (\\(\\lambda\\) = 0.347). A reasonably high breach rate for a system is between 0.2 and 0.33.\nFrom my own experience, an unstable system might experience between 1-4 technology outages per year; a \\(\\lambda\\) of 2 fits this nicely:\n\nggplot(data.frame(x = rpois(1e5, 2)), aes(x)) +\n  geom_hist_bw(binwidth = 1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_width(1, offset = 1)) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme_quo(minor = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the third risk, loss of customer, the firm has already experienced a loss, and expects this to increase. For loss of customer we also choose a \\(\\lambda\\) of 2.\n\n\nImpact\nDrawing from the IRIS 2022 report, the loss magnitude of a cybersecurity breach follows a log-normal distribution with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 12.56 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 3.07, which gives a log-transformed lognormal curve of:\n\nggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 25)), aes(x)) +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 12.56, sd = 3.07)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme_quo()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: from Making sense of the rlnorm() function in R:\n\nrlnorm(n = 1000000, meanlog = 7, sdlog = 75) and exp(rnorm(n = 1000000, mean = 7, sd = 75)) produce the same result\n\nAn expert estimate matching this outcome for a breach would have low (5%), high (95%) and most likely values of:\n\nqlnorm(c(0.05, 0.95, 0.5), meanlog = 12.56, sdlog = 3.07)\n\n[1]     1826.76 44442227.03   284930.34\n\n\nFor a technology outage, a mean of 0.1 and a standard deviation of 1.7 are reasonable choices for parameters that fit the data for outage duration from the 2022 VOID Report:\n\nggplot(data.frame(x = rlnorm(1e3, meanlog = 0.1, sdlog = 1.7)), aes(x)) +\n  geom_hist_bw(binwidth = 1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 80)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme_quo(minor = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives low (5%), high (95%) and most likely values of:\n\nqlnorm(c(0.05, 0.95, 0.5), meanlog = 0.1, sdlog = 1.7)\n\n[1]  0.06745793 18.10614106  1.10517092\n\n\nThis fits with my own experience; most outages last around an hour, and 95% of outages are resolved in 18 hours or less.

Over the years, the widget system has become an integral part of our services in managing widgets for our clients. In reviewing the system, three major risks were identified: First, the age of the technology prevents updating components of the system that no longer meet contemporary cybersecurity standards, which increases the risk of a breach. Second, the system is less reliable and experiences frequent outages, typically about 2 major outages per year, which results in lost revenue, contractual penalties, and overtime pay to recover from the incident. Third, limitations of the widget system have started to affect sales - we have recently lost a customer due to the functional obsolescence of the widget system, and expect to both lose more existing and prospective customers in the future due to increased competition in the widget management market.",

The paper tests a 10% reduction in MTTR using Monte Carlo simulation, and found:\n\n“Yikes! Even though in the simulation the improvement always worked, 38% of the simulations had the MTTR difference fall below zero for Company A, 40% for Company B, and 20% for Company C. Looking at the absolute change in MTTR, the probability of seeing at least a 15-minute improvement is only 49%, 50%, and 64%, respectively. Even though the product in the scenario worked and shortened incidents, the odds of detecting any improvement at all are well outside the tolerance of 10% random flukes.”\n\nSafety Differently argues that we shouldn’t measure success based on the absence of negative events. We can use real data on data breaches and Monte Carlo simulation to explore the question, “Is an organization’s breach rate a useful metric?”",

A sample period of 500 years or more is needed to have confidence that the breach rate has been reduced.\nRealistically, this means that the only way to test the effectiveness of security controls is by sampling across large numbers of firms. A single organization simply won’t have enough data to make reasonable conclusions based on events that happen so infrequently.",

    "text": "Background\nThe Risk Value Analysis found that a firm’s executive is unlikely to invest in reducing the risk of a large security breach, suggesting that security spending should be presented differently:\n\nAt the firm level, I think this means that security leaders shouldn’t present security as an investment. As with safety, I think the main argument for better security is a moral or emotional case: we care about security because we care about our customers, partners, and other stakeholders. Also, people are typically loss-averse, so expressing security risk in those terms will better connect with decision makers. Using Tail value at risk or Loss Exceedance Curves express loss in this way - “There’s a 5% chance of cybersecurity losses exceeding $780,000 and a 1% chance of losses exceeding $25,000,000 over the next year.” I also think it means security leaders should be mindful of how they spend their limited funds, by maximizing investments in what works.\n\nThis analysis explores different approaches to communicating that risk with the goal of promoting decisions on security spending so that all participants are satisfied with the outcome, informed by prior work on risk communication and risk perception, including the work of Lace Padilla, and Cyentia’s analysis on tail value at risk.",

    "text": "Background\nIn 2021, Google published a report exploring the limitations of using Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR), Incident Metrics in SRE: Critically Evaluating MTTR and Friends. Since then, additional articles and reports have been published that are also critical of MTTR and TTR in general, explicitly advocating that “organizations should stop using MTTX, or TTx data in general”. From my experience with cybersecurity incident data, I believe it is a mistake to abandon measurements of incidents entirely, and instead ask the question, under what conditions does incident duration indicate improvement?\nKey observations and arguments from the 2021 Google paper include:\n\nIncident duration appears to be lognormal (the paper did not test if the lognormal distribution was the best fit)\nA Monte Carlo simulation comparing two samples of incidents, one with no change in duration, and a second with a 10% reduction in duration, MTTR did not reliably indicate the improvement\nImprovements in MTTR can be observed even when there is no change in the underlying distribution\nLarger sample sizes (more incidents) make detecting the change more reliable - in the original simulation, the sample sizes ranged from approximately 50-300\nMedian and 95th percentile don’t work well either\nGeometric mean does just work, but only with a sample size of 500+\nMeasuring incident duration doesn’t account for changes in incident frequency\n\nThe article also calls out some exceptions where measuring duration is effective: first, when your data is large enough, as with Backblaze statistics on hard disk reliability, and second, when the change in duration is large enough, such as an 80% reduction in duration.\nSubsequent reports from VOID referenced the Google paper and argued:\n\nIncident duration is long-tailed and appear lognormal (2021, 2022)\n“MTTx are Shallow Data”, an oversimplification of a complex, messy event (2021)\nOrganizations should stop using MTTx and TTx data (2021, 2022, 2024)\nIncident duration appears lognormal for some organizations, but not for others (2022)\nReplicated the Monte Carlo simulation from the Google paper (2022)\n\nIn the cybersecurity domain, the Cyentia Institute has published reports analyzing breach data, looking at both frequency and impact (cost). Their IRIS 2022 report found that, like outage incident duration, security breach losses closely follow a lognormal distribution. Like the Google and VOID reports, the IRIS also points out that the mean is a poor indicator of a ‘typical’ loss, the median or geometric mean are better summaries, and organizations should also be concerned with tail risk - extreme events at the 90, 95, and 99th percentile.\nAdditionally, despite the challenges with using lognormal data, the 2024 Ransomware Report showed that losses from ransomware have significantly increased between 2019 and 2023.",

    "section": "Analysis",
    "text": "Analysis\nWhile I agree that the mean (average) is misleading and should not be used with incident impact data (duration or costs), I believe it is a mistake to stop using impact data entirely. A Monte Carlo simulation can help answer the underlying question raised by the Google research, “under what conditions does incident duration indicate improvement?” Put differently, how large of a sample size is needed to detect a given level of improvement (reduction) in incident duration?\n\nAssumptions\nWhile the 2022 VOID Report challenged the notion that incident duration is lognormal, the Google report and my own experience suggest otherwise: similar to cybersecurity impact, incident duration closely follows a lognormal distribution. In my own work, I have found that incidents that are qualitatively different may not be lognormal, and that could well be what was happening in the VOID report, but we lack the context to know for sure. To simplify the analysis, the incident frequency will be held constant. (Side note: Cyentia found that cybersecurity breach frequency followed a Poisson lognormal distribution)\n\n\nApproach\nTo determine the threshold of incidents needed to detect changes in duration, we follow a similar methodology as the Google paper:\n\nRandomly sample from an artificial but representative lognormal distribution of incident duration\nAdjust the duration of one of the populations by a set percentage to simulate improvement\nDetermine if there is a statistically significant improvement in incident duration\n\nFor step 3, we use the geometric mean and Student’s t-test on the samples, after log-transforming the data. From my research and understanding, this is a reasonable approach if the underlying distributions are truly lognormal, which is true by design.\nTo determine a representative distribution, we can borrow data from the Google report, which lists the p95 and p50 for three companies - we’ll infer p05 and the lognormal parameters using data from Company B:\n\nlnorm_param(p05 = 9, p95 = 528, p50 = 67)\n\n$meanlog\n[1] 4.23316\n\n$sdlog\n[1] 1.237761\n\n$mdiff\n[1] -0.02806642\n\n\nUsing trial and error, we find that 9 minutes is the closest match to p05 when the median is 67 minutes. From this, we can create a representative distribution:\n\nmeanlog &lt;- 4.25\nsdlog &lt;- 1.25\nqlnorm(c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95), meanlog = meanlog, sdlog = sdlog)\n\n[1]   8.970424  70.105412 547.885889\n\n\nThis is reasonably close to the Company B data, and passes the sniff test: 5% of incidents resolved in less than 9 minutes, 50% resolved in 70 minutes or less, and 95% resolved under 548 minutes (9 hours 8 minutes).\n\n\nSimulations\nFirst, test at the 10% improvement level, with a sample size (\\(N\\)) of 100, which is about 1 year’s worth of incidents. A single test is successful if the experimental group has a lower geometric mean and a positive t-test (p &lt; 0.05) on the log-transformed data.\n\nsingle_test &lt;- function(n, improvement) {\n  control &lt;- rlnorm(n, meanlog = meanlog, sdlog = sdlog)\n  experiment &lt;- rlnorm(n, meanlog = meanlog, sdlog = sdlog) * (1 - improvement)\n\n  list(gmean(control), gmean(experiment), t.test(log(control), log(experiment)))\n}\n\nsingle_test(100, 0.1)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 62.2113\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 62.20182\n\n[[3]]\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  log(control) and log(experiment)\nt = 0.00088771, df = 197.64, p-value = 0.9993\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.3385153  0.3388202\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n 4.130537  4.130384 \n\n\nFor most tests, the p-value is well above 0.05. How often does the test succeed? We’ll set the bar slightly higher than the Google paper and target a 95% success rate.\nWe’ll use a slightly different function that is more easily converted into a data frame, and run only 10,000 trials to speed things up:\n\ntest_change &lt;- function(n, improvement) {\n  control &lt;- rlnorm(n, meanlog = meanlog, sdlog = sdlog)\n  experiment &lt;- rlnorm(n, meanlog = meanlog, sdlog = sdlog) * (1 - improvement)\n\n  c(\n    control_gmean = gmean(control), experiment_gmean = gmean(experiment),\n    p_value = t.test(log(control), log(experiment))$p.value\n  )\n}\n\nsimulate_test &lt;- function(n, improvement, trials = 10000, p_value_target = 0.05) {\n  map(1:trials, \\(i) as_tibble_row(test_change(n, improvement))) |&gt;\n    list_rbind() |&gt;\n    mutate(\n      success = (.data$control_gmean &gt; .data$experiment_gmean) & (.data$p_value &lt; p_value_target)\n    )\n}\n\nresults &lt;- simulate_test(100, 0.1)\nhead(results, 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   control_gmean experiment_gmean p_value success\n           &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  \n 1          76.2             53.3  0.0333 TRUE   \n 2          58.2             71.8  0.256  FALSE  \n 3          70.3             58.1  0.269  FALSE  \n 4          69.2             61.0  0.493  FALSE  \n 5          77.7             65.0  0.268  FALSE  \n 6          75.0             70.9  0.738  FALSE  \n 7          68.5             56.4  0.301  FALSE  \n 8          83.0             65.8  0.217  FALSE  \n 9          65.1             69.4  0.735  FALSE  \n10          81.5             57.8  0.0578 FALSE  \n\nmean(results$success)\n\n[1] 0.0884\n\n\nFor a sample size of 100, we successfully detect a statistically significant change about 8% of the time.

    "text": "Discussion\nSo, what does this analysis tell us?\n\nMTTR (Mean Time to Resolve) is a misleading metric, and organizations should stop using it.\n\nThe Google, VOID and Cyentia research all agree that the mean (average) is a poor summary metric for lognormal and other long-tail distributions. I also agree and that assumption is built-in to the analysis. However, I agree with the Cyentia research that the geometric mean is a reasonable value for the ‘typical’ incident - this is suggested in the Google paper.\n\nLarge samples are required to detect changes in underlying incident duration, making it less useful at an organizational level.\n\nThe Google paper found that sample sizes of 500+ were needed to detect a 10% reduction in the underlying distribution; this analysis suggested 4000 is a better threshold. Even at organizations with high levels of incidents, this represents several years of data, enough that only large changes (50% or greater reduction in underlying TTR) will be detected in a reasonable time frame.\n\nTTR (incident duration) can be a useful measure at a larger scale, including comparisons across different organizations.\n\nWhile at an individual organization level, incident duration (TTR) is noisy, it becomes meaningful at large scales. Some organizations do experience repeatable failures at scale, including the Backblaze hard drive failure example cited in the Google paper, but TTR is more useful for comparisons across organizations. I believe this explains why the Accelerate State of DevOps Report (DORA) research is able to find meaningful correlations between “Failed deployment recovery time”, the other 3 key DORA metrics, and other measures of performance. The 2024 report surveyed 3,000 people, which should represent hundreds (or more) different organizations. This would appear to be above a threshold to detect differences, especially given the range of possible responses (1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year).\nIn the cybersecurity space, large (public) incidents happen relatively infrequently, about once every 3-10 years, depending on the size of the organization, according to the Cyentia IRIS report. Because of this, metrics on breaches gathered at the organizational level don’t provide meaningful insights, as I argued in Measuring Changes in Breach Rates. However, we’ve also learned that looking at data across organizations can and does provide useful learning. We can accomplish the same thing in the reliability/resilience space by using similar measures.\nTTR is a useful measure for cross-company comparison because it is a shallow measure, and reflects the external consumer/user experience. One study I’d like to see is a deep-dive analysis on data from Downdetector, examining differences in groups or clusters of organizations (perhaps this has already been done!) which could identify common factors that contribute to success.",
