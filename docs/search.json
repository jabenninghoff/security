    "text": "Analysis\nWhat can we learn from these simulations? While a security investment is more likely than not to have a positive return, it’s not a particularly good bet. Over a reasonable planning horizon for a typical executive, it’s hard for an investment with a variable return to compete with investments that have a clear expected positive return. As a CISO, it’s a reasonable choice to simply maintain the status quo of the baseline risk, as there’s a good chance that there will be no breaches (25%) or breaches with lower impact:\n\nbaseline_forecast |&gt;\n  pull(npv) |&gt;\n  quantile(0.5) |&gt;\n  currency()\n\n        50% \n$254,008.05 \n\n\nPut another way, the analysis helps explain why firms don’t invest more in security: the firms’ managers are better off prioritizing non-security investments, and (potentially) blaming the CISO when breaches do occur, especially if they have limited their risk by purchasing cybersecurity insurance. A rational manager will minimize investments in security unless mandated by insurance or if increasing security spend is more than offset by reductions in premiums.\nFor the most part, this is what we often see in practice: security leaders struggling to get funding to improve security beyond what is minimally expected by external stakeholders (clients, regulators, and insurers). However, we also see certain larger organizations invest more in security, like large banks and other financial institutions, why is this? Work done by VivoSecurity in forecasting data breaches suggests an answer. Vivo found a positive correlation between the size of an organization and the likelihood of a security breach (which has also been identified by others, like Cyentia), and also found a negative correlation with the number of CISAs and CISSPs on staff. The correlation was stronger when looking at the effect on larger breaches.\nI believe what this correlation shows is that the overall level of security investment at a firm, as measured by the headcount of certified professionals, has a big impact on reducing the likelihood of the largest breaches of $1M or higher. From the same presentation, the Vivo model predicts fairly frequent small breaches (under $100K) at three of the largest Canadian banks, but large breaches are very rare (under 1% for breaches in the $1M-$10M range). The high level of investment at older banks may also be partly explained by the fact that their security programs predate commercial cyber insurance. This insight is not captured in the simple model presented here.",

    "section": "Implications",
    "text": "Implications\nWhat are the implications for security? At a macro level, I think this is an argument for regulation, either government regulation or private regulation through the insurance market. Historically we’ve seen both happen in fire safety: government regulation through building codes has reduced the risk of fire and loss of life over time, and insurance-driven regulations - UL, founded as Underwriters Laboratories, was initially funded by fire insurance companies.\nAt the firm level, I think this means that security leaders shouldn’t present security as an investment. As with safety, I think the main argument for better security is a moral or emotional case: we care about security because we care about our customers, partners, and other stakeholders. Also, people are typically loss-averse, so expressing security risk in those terms will better connect with decision makers. Using Tail value at risk or Loss Exceedance Curves express loss in this way - “There’s a 5% chance of losses exceeding $780,000 and a 1% of losses exceeding $25,000,000 over the next year.” I also think it means security leaders should be mindful of how they spend their limited funds, by maximizing investments in what works.",

The paper tests a 10% reduction in MTTR using Monte Carlo simulation, and found:\n\n“Yikes! Even though in the simulation the improvement always worked, 38% of the simulations had the MTTR difference fall below zero for Company A, 40% for Company B, and 20% for Company C. Looking at the absolute change in MTTR, the probability of seeing at least a 15-minute improvement is only 49%, 50%, and 64%, respectively. Even though the product in the scenario worked and shortened incidents, the odds of detecting any improvement at all are well outside the tolerance of 10% random flukes.”\n\nSafety Differently argues that we shouldn’t measure success based on the absence of negative events. We can use real data on data breaches and Monte Carlo simulation to explore the question, “Is an organization’s breach rate a useful metric?”",

A sample period of 500 years or more is needed to have confidence that the breach rate has been reduced.\nRealistically, this means that the only way to test the effectiveness of security controls is by sampling across large numbers of firms.

Second, the system is less reliable and experiences frequent outages, typically about 2 major outages per year, which results in lost revenue, contractual penalties, and overtime pay to recover from the incident. Third, limitations of the widget system have started to affect sales - we have recently lost a customer due to the functional obsolescence of the widget system, and expect to both lose more existing and prospective customers in the future due to increased competition in the widget management market.",

    "text": "Example Data\nGenerate realistic example data to populate the Excel spreadsheet. As discovered in practice, while the initial risks (“cybersecurity breach” and “technology outage”) are raised by the technology team, we find that the business risks (here represented by “loss of customer”) are significantly larger, caused by the functional obsolescence of the inventory system.\n\nFrequency\nExperts are asked to estimate the frequency of an adverse event, which is used as the average arrival rate for a Poisson distribution (\\(\\lambda\\)).\nFrom my breach rate analysis, the largest firms experience a cybersecurity breach about once every three years (\\(\\lambda\\) = 0.347). A reasonably high breach rate for a system is between 0.2 and 0.33.\nFrom my own experience, an unstable system might experience between 1-4 technology outages per year; a \\(\\lambda\\) of 2 fits this nicely:\n\nggplot(data.frame(x = rpois(1e5, 2)), aes(x)) +\n  geom_hist_bw(binwidth = 1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_width(1, offset = 1)) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme_quo(minor = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the third risk, loss of customer, the firm has already experienced a loss, and expects this to increase. For loss of customer we also choose a \\(\\lambda\\) of 2.\n\n\nImpact\nDrawing from the IRIS 2022 report, the loss magnitude of a cybersecurity breach follows a log-normal distribution with a mean (\\(\\mu\\)) of 12.56 and a standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) of 3.07, which gives a log-transformed lognormal curve of:\n\nggplot(data.frame(x = c(0, 25)), aes(x)) +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 12.56, sd = 3.07)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme_quo()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: from Making sense of the rlnorm() function in R:\n\nrlnorm(n = 1000000, meanlog = 7, sdlog = 75) and exp(rnorm(n = 1000000, mean = 7, sd = 75)) produce the same result\n\nAn expert estimate matching this outcome for a breach would have low (5%), high (95%) and most likely values of:\n\nqlnorm(c(0.05, 0.95, 0.5), meanlog = 12.56, sdlog = 3.07)\n\n[1]     1826.76 44442227.03   284930.34\n\n\nFor a technology outage, a mean of 0.1 and a standard deviation of 1.7 are reasonable choices for parameters that fit the data for outage duration from the 2022 VOID Report:\n\nggplot(data.frame(x = rlnorm(1e3, meanlog = 0.1, sdlog = 1.7)), aes(x)) +\n  geom_hist_bw(binwidth = 1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 80)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +\n  theme_quo(minor = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gives low (5%), high (95%) and most likely values of:\n\nqlnorm(c(0.05, 0.95, 0.5), meanlog = 0.1, sdlog = 1.7)\n\n[1]  0.06745793 18.10614106  1.10517092\n\n\nThis fits with my own experience; most outages last around an hour, and 95% of outages are resolved in 18 hours or less. From this, we can calculate a reasonable outage cost by multiplying by a per-hour rate. We assume that the main cost is caused by response and overtime paid out to catch up after the system is restored, $10K/hour.\n\nqlnorm(c(0.05, 0.95, 0.5), meanlog = 0.1, sdlog = 1.7) * 10000\n\n[1]    674.5793 181061.4106  11051.7092\n\n\nFor loss of customer, we estimate the low (5%) and high (95%) values at $100K and $20M respectively; these are reasonable choices given the size of the firm. We can test this by calculating the most likely value, after determining the mean and standard deviation using the approach from this StackExchange Post:\nThe mean is calculated using: \\(\\mu = \\large \\frac{\\log(high) - \\log(low)}{2}\\)\n\nmeanlog_customer &lt;- ((log(20000000) - log(100000)) / 2) + log(100000)\nmeanlog_customer\n\n[1] 14.16208\n\n\nThe standard deviation is calculated using: \\(\\DeclareMathOperator{\\qnorm}{qnorm} \\large \\sigma = \\frac{\\log(high) - \\log(low)}{2 \\times \\qnorm(0.95)}\\)\n\nsdlog_customer &lt;- (log(20000000) - log(100000)) / (2 * qnorm(0.95))\nsdlog_customer\n\n[1] 1.610574\n\n\nFrom this we get a customer impact range of:\n\nqlnorm(c(0.05, 0.95, 0.5), meanlog = meanlog_customer, sdlog = sdlog_customer)\n\n[1]   100000 20000000  1414214",
