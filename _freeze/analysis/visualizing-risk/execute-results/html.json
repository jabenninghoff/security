As with safety, I think the main argument for better security is a moral or emotional\ncase: we care about security because we care about our customers, partners, and other stakeholders.\nAlso, people are typically loss-averse, so expressing security risk in those terms will better\nconnect with decision makers. Using\n[Tail value at risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_value_at_risk) or\n[Loss Exceedance Curves](https://www.cyentia.com/communicating-risk-loss-exceedance-curves/) express\nloss in this way - \"There's a 5% chance of cybersecurity losses exceeding \\$780,000 and a 1% chance\nof losses exceeding \\$25,000,000 over the next year.\" I also think it means security leaders should\nbe mindful of *how* they spend their limited funds, by maximizing investments in\n[what works](https://doi.org/10.1080/23738871.2024.2335461).\n\nThis analysis explores different approaches to communicating that risk with the goal of promoting\ndecisions on security spending so that all participants are satisfied with the outcome, informed by\nprior work on risk communication and risk perception, including the work of\n[Lace Padilla](http://www.lacepadilla.com), and Cyentia's\n[analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiMBMsN_4j4) on tail value at risk.\n",
